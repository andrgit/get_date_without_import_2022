2 modules:
my_get_date_without_imports and my_get_date_with_datetime

Task1:
Write a function that receives a date and a number of days to add. (Without use datetime module)
The function will need to calculate the new date taking into consideration the calendar.

Example 1:
Input: Date: 10.01.2008, number_of_days: 10
Output: 20.01.2008

Example 2:
Input: Date: 29.06.2020, number_of_days: 8
Output: 07.07.2020

*Please, use Python to solve this task
** You can use datetime module if you want to ease date parsing, but don't use it for calculation algorithm.
*** Please, upload solution to GitHub - just create public repo and send us the link when solution would be ready.
